# Kitchen

Kitchen is a Dashboard where you can visualize and browse your servers.
It never has been so easy to find and orginize all your nodes!

## How it works

Data is taken from a Chef repository's node data bag

## Installation

We will need python 2.6+, Django 1.3+ and django-celery

`pip install django django-celery`
